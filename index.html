<p>
Although various search-based program repair techniques show promising results in generating a large number of patches, prior studies show that most of these patches are often only plausible but incorrect. Specifically, SPR generates 28 out of 40 (i.e, 70%) plausible but incorrect patches, while GenProg generates 50 out of 53 (i.e., 94.33%) plausible patches, for the GenProg benchmarks.
</p>
<br \>
<p>
To better understand the nature of the plausible patches, we performed a manual inspection on all the machine-generated patches produced by SPR and GenProg (including plausible and correct patches) as well as on the correct developer-provided patches for these bugs. Specifically, we manually analyzed each patch and attempted to answer two questions:
 <dl>
	<dt>Q1:</dt><dd> What makes a given patch plausible? Why is it incorrect (i.e., does not capture the semantics of the developer-provided patch)?</dd>
	<dt>Q2:</dt><dd> Do the plausible patches, as a whole, share any common syntactic features that explain their "plausibility'' as well as distinguish them from the pool of correct patches (human as well as machine generated)?</dd>
</dl>
The aim was to find a compact set of syntactic features that are independent of the repair templates used by the tool.
